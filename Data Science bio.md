I am Smit Doshi, a Computer Science Graduate student at NC State University specialising in Data Science.

I have worked on certain data science projects in my academics so far, one of which was based on applying machine learning algorithms to natural language processing in performing semantic analysis and classification over a large dataset of Quora question samples in Python and R. 
Iâ€™ve also worked on Spatial Scan statistics in finding the outlier detection in precipitation data by using spatial-temporal data mining techniques on NOAA data.

Currently I'm fulfilling the responsibility of an intern software engineer at NCSU-ITng's OSCAR labs using my web-scraping skills to gain useful information on rare-disease communities and specialists using natural language processing.

I have also achieved SAS Programming 1: Essentials certification through workshops in my undergraduate college and have knowledge about the modelling softwares like SAS Enterprise Guide and Miner.

Being an avid data science enthusiast, I possess affinity towards problem-solving, mathematics, statistics and analytical domains.

Through my internship, academics and projects, I've reached some depth into the data science field and desire to go much further by learning and applying my knowledge to real-world scenarios.

My enclosed resume expands on some of my other projects and technical skills as well. Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Sincerely,
